!!Work in progress!!

A simple To-Do list app using local storage from a self-study fullstack web developer. 

Planning to add more advanced features over time.

This is just a front-end practice project, to test animations and styling.

After finishing MVP I will try to add more interesting features in other branches and merge them with master.
